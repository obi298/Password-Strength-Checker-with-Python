# Password-Strength-Checker-with-Python

In the world of cybersecurity, millions of breaches happen every year. Many of those breaches are due to users having 
weak passwords, or using the same password from multiple sites. Doing this only increases the risk of identity theft, 
and sensitive data being compromised.

Users should ensure that their passwords are strong and hard to guess in order to prevent losing any sensitive information
to any attackers. 


This code will prompt the user to enter a password and inform the user on whether the passwords is strong or not.

When users enters a password that doesn't meet the requirements, the code will give suggestions on what they should add in their password.

If a user enters a strong password that meets all the requirements, the code will say "Password is good to go."
